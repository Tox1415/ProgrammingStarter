# Designing an algorithm.

## What is an algorithm?

Let's start with some song lyrics. Imagine you've been invited to a posh party and need to dress for the occasion. What are you going to do?

> I'm puttin' on my top hat,  
> Tyin' up my white tie,  
> Brushin' off my tails.  
> I'm dudin' up my shirt front,  
> Puttin' in the shirt studs,  
> Polishin' my nails,  

Top Hat, White Tie and Tails. Irving Berlin (1935)

How would that all work out?
