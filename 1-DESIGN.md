# Designing an algorithm.

## What is an algorithm?

Let's start with some song lyrics. Imagine you've been invited to a posh party and need to dress for the occasion. What are you going to do?

> I'm puttin' on my top hat,  
> Tyin' up my white tie,  
> Brushin' off my tails.  
> I'm dudin' up my shirt front,  
> Puttin' in the shirt studs,  
> Polishin' my nails,  

Top Hat, White Tie and Tails. Irving Berlin (1935)

How would that all work out? 

[White Tie, Top Hat and Tails, Willie Rushton] (https://youtu.be/v6b3a79DoQk)

An algorithm is a set of instructions which, when execeuted in order, will achieve a specific objective. It computing terms, it can be seen as the blueprint for a computer program and the same algorithm can be implemented in a variety of languages while still retaining the same underlying logic and structure.
